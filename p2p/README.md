This crate provides data types used in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol.

### Support for 16-bit pointer sizes

16-bit pointer sizes are not supported, and we can't promise they will be. If you care about them
please let us know, so we can know how large the interest is and possibly decide to support them.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This library should always compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.74.0**.
