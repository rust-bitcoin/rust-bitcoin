# 0.12.1 - 2023-04-09
- Removed `FromHex` trait from all hashes.

Note: Parsing from strings is now done using the corresponding `FromStr` implementations.

# 0.12.0 - 2023-03-05

0.12 is a significant release. We pulled the repository into the rust-bitcoin
repo to improve our integration testing and to get more eyes on this crate. We
began the process of replacing the hex functionality in this crate with a more
performant, dedicated crate, and otherwise cleaning up the API as we look forward
to 1.0.

* Move crate from [original repo](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes) to the
`rust-bitcoin` repository. Commit history was lost during move, for commit history see the original
repository. Tip of bitcoin_hashes:master at time of import: 54c16249e06cc6b7870c7fc07d90f489d82647c7

# 0.11.0 - 2022-06-25

The major change in this version is the increase of the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) from
1.29 to 1.41.1. This is a big change because it introduces Rust Edition 2018 to the codebase along
with all the benefits that brings. We also did a bunch of optimisations to speed up encoding and
decoding hex strings.

## Breaking changes

* [Enable edition 2018 and bump MSRV to Rust 1.41.1](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/136)

## New features/APIs

* [Add `all_zeros` to `Hash` trait](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/148)
* [Implement `Write` on `HmacEngine`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/133)
* [Introduce `HexWriter`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/156), makes serialising hex faster
* [Implement `Read` on `HexIterator`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/135), makes deserialising hex faster

## Other improvements

* Use `rotate_left` [instead of custom macro](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/162)
* [Enable clippy on CI](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/152)
* Various docs fixes
* [Improve feature test coverage](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/147)
* [Add a disabled `rustfmt.toml`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/141) to improve interaction with auto-formatting in editors


# 0.10.0 - 2021-07-05

* Increase `core2` to released version of 0.3.0

# 0.9.7 - 2021-06-17

* Introduce `alloc` feature and `core2` dependency for nostd support (this feature has MSRV of 1.36 rather than 1.29)

# 0.9.6 - 2021-05-03

* Re-export `core` as `_export::_core`. This resolves an issue when calling several exported macros with the `std` feature.

# 0.9.5 - 2021-04-28

* Add [`#[repr(transparent)]` to all newtype wrappers](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/108/)
* Add [missing `#derive`s](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/110/)
* Replace `fuzztarget` feature with [use of `cfg(fuzzing)`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/111/)
* Use [`core` rather than `std`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/118/) and [fix `no_std` compilation](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes/pull/122/)

Note that we have stopped re-exporting the `core` crate when compiling without `std`. This is technically a breaking change but it is hard to imagine what user might be affected.
