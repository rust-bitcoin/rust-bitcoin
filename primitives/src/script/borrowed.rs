/// Bitcoin script slice.
///
/// *[See also the `bitcoin::script` module](super).*
///
/// `Script` is a script slice, the most primitive script type. It's usually seen in its borrowed
/// form `&Script`. It is always encoded as a series of bytes representing the opcodes and data
/// pushes.
///
/// ## Validity
///
/// `Script` does not have any validity invariants - it's essentially just a marked slice of
/// bytes. This is similar to [`Path`](std::path::Path) vs [`OsStr`](std::ffi::OsStr) where they
/// are trivially cast-able to each-other and `Path` doesn't guarantee being a usable FS path but
/// having a newtype still has value because of added methods, readability and basic type checking.
///
/// Although at least data pushes could be checked not to overflow the script, bad scripts are
/// allowed to be in a transaction (outputs just become unspendable) and there even are such
/// transactions in the chain. Thus we must allow such scripts to be placed in the transaction.
///
/// ## Slicing safety
///
/// Slicing is similar to how `str` works: some ranges may be incorrect and indexing by
/// `usize` is not supported. However, as opposed to `std`, we have no way of checking
/// correctness without causing linear complexity so there are **no panics on invalid
/// ranges!** If you supply an invalid range, you'll get a garbled script.
///
/// The range is considered valid if it's at a boundary of instruction. Care must be taken
/// especially with push operations because you could get a reference to arbitrary
/// attacker-supplied bytes that look like a valid script.
///
/// It is recommended to use `.instructions()` method to get an iterator over script
/// instructions and work with that instead.
///
/// ## Memory safety
///
/// The type is `#[repr(transparent)]` for internal purposes only!
/// No consumer crate may rely on the representation of the struct!
///
/// ## References
///
