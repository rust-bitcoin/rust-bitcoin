# Rust Bitcoin - primitive types.

This crate provides primitive data types that are used throughout the
[`rust-bitcoin`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin) ecosystem.

## Semver compliance

Functions marked as unstable (e.g. `foo__unstable`) are not guaranteed to uphold semver compliance.
They are primarily provided to support `rust-bitcoin`.

## `bitcoin-primitives 0.102.0`

This is the start of the 1.0.0 release candidate cycle. We will
endeavour to not release breaking changes unless totally necessary and
will honour semver rules as usual. From this release forward we will
semver trick as possible in subsequent releases to assist downstream
users testing these releases.

Thanks for your patience and help.
