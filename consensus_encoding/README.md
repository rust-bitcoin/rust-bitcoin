# Bitcoin Consensus Encoding

This crate provides traits that can be used to encode/decode objects in a consensus-consistent way.

## `consensus_encoding 0.1.0`

This is the start of the `v1.0.0` release candidate cycle. We will
endeavour to not release breaking changes unless totally necessary and
will honour semver rules as usual. From this release forward we will
semver trick as possible in subsequent releases to assist downstream
users testing these releases.

Thanks for your patience and help.
